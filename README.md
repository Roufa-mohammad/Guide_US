# Guide_Us

this is my first Educational website frontend design.

Technologies used are **Angularjs** , **Bootstrap** for responsible web design.

**Application:**
        
   This educational website is named **GUIDE_US**, based on the **MOTO** behind guiding students after their current education.

We did this project to get **Internship** in UR2D

This is how it looks if the website loads after you clone into your machine.
